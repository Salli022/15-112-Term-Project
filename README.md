Here is my game Retro Tennis!!!! In this game, you play one set of tennis against a computer. You are able to change the court that the game is played on which impacts the movement of the ball and also hit different types of shots (slice, topspin or lob). In order to run this program you need to run the main.py file. 

The libraries that need to be imported are cmu_graphics, PIL, os (pathlib), math and random.
